Hi, I am currently in my final year of a Master's degree in Computer Science at Warsaw University of Technology. My academic interests include nature-inspired algorithms, neural networks, cryptography, and more. I have primarily used Python and C++ for my academic assignments and various outside projects. Additionally, I have some experience with Julia, C#, and JavaScript.
